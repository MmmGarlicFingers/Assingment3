This website is probably not going to be used for much beyond this class. At first I kind of wanted to make this into a personal website since I'm in co-op atm. My standards for schoolwork and actual actual work are very different though, and I decided to just stick with the lower schoolwork standards here and get kinda silly with it. As much as I do want a professionally done site, I also don't want to spend more than one day working on an assignment. It's human nature to take the path of least resistance, and that is what I've done here. I don't want to spend hours agonizing over every little detail to make a perfect site that will impress recruiters. I want to pass the class lol.
